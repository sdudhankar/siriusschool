        <h2>Flume</h2>
        Apache Flume is a tool/service/data ingestion mechanism for collecting aggregating and transporting large amounts of streaming data such as log files, events (etc...) from various sources to a centralized data store.

Flume is a highly reliable, distributed, and configurable tool. It is principally designed to copy streaming data (log data) from various web servers to HDFS.
        Using Hive, we can skip the requirement of the traditional approach of writing complex MapReduce programs. Hive
        supports Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and User Defined Functions (UDF).
