        To really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background. 
        Here is Gartner’s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the go-to definition):<br><br>
        <b> "Big data is data that contains greater 
                <font color="green">variety</font> arriving in increasing 
                <font color="green">volumes</font> and with ever-higher 
                <font color="green">velocity</font>."</b>
                 This is known as the three Vs.<br><br>
        <i>Simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. 
        These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them.
         But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.</i><br><br>
Two more Vs have emerged over the past few years: value and veracity.
Data has intrinsic value. But it’s of no use until that value is discovered. <br><br>
<p><b>Equally important:<i>How truthful is your data—and how much can you rely on it?</i></b> 
Today, big data has become capital. Think of some of the world’s biggest tech companies. A large part of the value they offer comes from their data, 
which they’re constantly analysing to produce more efficiency and develop new products.</p>
Recent technological breakthroughs have exponentially reduced the cost of data storage and compute, making it easier and less expensive to store more data than ever before. With an increased volume of big data now cheaper and more accessible, you can make more accurate and precise business decisions.
Finding value in big data isn’t only about analysing it (which is a whole other benefit). It’s an entire discovery process that requires insightful analysts, business users, and executives who ask the right questions, recognize patterns, make informed assumptions, and predict behaviour.

        with real time project level explanations and hands on approach.</p>
